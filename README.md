# InfoBot
InfoBot is a basic bot for DiscordJS.

I made this bot to test the Discord API and DiscordJS Module
you can use this as a template for your bots, if you find an issue report it!

If you want to run it you need to install NodeJS and dependencies

NodeJS:

https://nodejs.org

Dependencies:

$ npm i



After installing nodejs and dependencies and making a .env file, run this commands in the folder that you downloaded:

$ node deploy-commands.js   (It will register new commands to the server) 

$ node index.js   (It start the bot)
